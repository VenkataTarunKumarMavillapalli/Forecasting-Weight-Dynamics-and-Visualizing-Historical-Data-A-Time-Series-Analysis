Forecasting Weight Dynamics and Visualizing Historical Data A Time Series Analysis

Objective:
1. Developing forecasting models to predict an insect colony weight using colony and environmental data.
2. Created a Power BI dashboard to visualize the relationships between colony weight and other factors, as well as the historical data overall.

Features: Date, Colony Activity, Dead Colony Weight, Nest Temperature, Nest Humidity, Red Luminous Intensity, Green Luminous Intensity, Blue Luminous Intensity, White Luminous Intensity, IR Luminous Intensity, Sound Intensity, Nest Weight

Performed: 
Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploring both colony data and environmental data to understand their characteristics and identify patterns and correlations and handle outliers.

Feature Engineering: Engineered additional features that capture the relationships between colony features and environmental factors.

Model Development: 
1. Developed time series forecasting models for the nest weight using techniques like ARIMA, SARIMA, linear regression, decision trees, generalized additive models, or machine learning algorithms.
2. Highlighted the interpretability of the models, such as examining coefficients, feature importance, or partial dependence plots.

Model Evaluation: Based on evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAPE)
1. Assessed model performance using MSE over a test set that will be provided to you along with the training dataset.
2. Explained the interpretability and insights derived from the models.

Power BI Dashboard: Created an interactive dashboard to visualize historical data effectively.
